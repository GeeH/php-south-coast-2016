    - title: Building APIs with Slim 3
      abstract: |
        Fast, discrete APIs are a key part of many web applications and Slim 3 is a fantastic platform for building them. With a focus on PSR-7, the new standard for HTTP messaging in PHP, Slim's middleware focus and ability to get out of the way ensure thats you can buld APIs that are a joy to work with. We'll cover content-type handling, accept header awareness, error handling and all the other things required to ensure that your APIs are easy to integrate with. By the end of this session you will be well placed to write your own APIs with Slim 3.

        Thanks to cloud computing, the ability to split processes on different machines is now very easy. During this talk Gianluca will share his experience with the Zend Framework Core Team to split their repository into different isolated components (one of the main features of ZF3) whilst retaining git history. This is a good case study due to their use of AWS, PHP and bash to split their git history of over 20,000 commits.

    He has been working in the computer software industry since before symbolics.com was registered as a domain name, before the term "cyberspace" was first used in fiction, when Linus Torvalds and Rasmus Lerdorf were still at high school, and Mrs. Zuckerberg had yet to give birth to a bouncing baby social network enabler; and has been developing for the Web in a variety of languages since the days when the Tim Berners-Lee's creation comprised less than 1,000 sites.

    Over those years, he has contributed to a number of open source projects: some still extant, others lost to history, including a minor submission to PHP's SPL. Currently he is coordinator and lead developer for the [PHPExcel](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel) library, and a coordinator and developer on the [PHPOffice](https://github.com/PHPOffice) library suite (PHPWord, PHPPresentation, PHPProject and PHPVisio). Most recently, he has been working on new datastructures such as Tries, Quadtrees and Matrices; hoping that he'll be able to get them included in SPL.

    His particular interests include PHP integration with office suites, Textual analysis, Geodata and geographic information systems, and "big data" and data analysis.

    - title: A Functional Guide to Cat Herding with PHP Generators
      abstract: |
        When working with arrays in PHP, three of the most useful functions available to us are array_map(), array_filter() and array_reduce(), which allow us to walk an array and manipulate the value of array elements, select a subset of values from an array, or reduce an array to a single value; all using a callback function to determine exactly what logic should be applied. The use of the callback makes them extremely flexible, and these functions can be particularly powerful, especially when combined (or chained) together.

         However, these functions only work with standard PHP arrays; so if we are using Generators as a data source instead of an array, then we can't take advantage of the functionality that they provide. Fortunately, it's very easy to emulate that functionality and apply it to Generators (and also to other Traversable objects like SPL Iterators), giving us access to all of the flexibility and power that mapping, filtering and reducing can offer, and with all the benefits that Generators can offer our code.

        So how do we go about implementing filter(), map() and reduce() functions for our Generators? How do we use those functions in our applications? Mark will be answering those two questions, and explaining how he keeps track of his cats armed only with a GPS Tracker, PHP Generators, and filter/map/reduce.

        [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8) was (finally) released on November 19th 2015, after almost 4 years of work and code commits by over 3,200 different contributors. Whilst it's pretty much the same as the Drupal that we know and, hopefully, love, a lot has changed behind the scenes and under the hood!

        In this talk, Oliver will highlight some of the new features and improvements in Drupal 8, and discuss some of the benefits to Drupal site builders, themers, and module developers. Oliver will also talk about some of the non-technical changes and the cultural shift from "not invented here" to "proudly found elsewhere", and how we are rejoining the PHP herd.

    - title: Profiling Your PHP Application
      abstract: |
        So, you've been through and changed all your double quotes to single quotes but your application still isn't running at the speed of light. What's going on?

        Making an application scale is generally seen as something that only the most magical of developers can do, but it's easy once you have the correct tools. Fortunately for us, these tools are freely available online!

        In this talk, we'll take a look at a few options that we have available to work out what our application is actually doing, help identify bottlenecks and fix them so that we can move on to the more important part of the project: delivering features.

        PhpSpec is a tool for "SpecBDD". Basically test-driven development (TDD) but without the word "test" in it. This talk shows how to effectively use PhpSpec for fun and/or profit, and the advantages to using it along side other tools like PHPUnit and why it's "literally" made of awesomesauce.

        We'll start off with a breakneck primer on unit testing and basic TDD concepts. Then we'll move on to getting set up with PhpSpec, followed by a guided tour of its main features. By the end of the talk you'll have techniques to take advantage of your natural inclination to lazyness to actually help you write better code.

      abstract: |
        Language runtimes do their best to meet all your development needs, but sometimes there's some random C library you need access to from a higher level language, and it's just not there.  Learning PHP's zvals and HashTables, and its score of macros and pointers can be intimidating and off-putting.  Sara will show that there's a better way:  HHVM extensions require little more experience than a firm knowledge of PHP, and a willingness to break things.  By the end of this presentation, we'll have live-coded a real-world extension wrapping a real-world library, and you'll be able to as well.
