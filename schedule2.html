                    So, you've been through and changed all your double quotes to single quotes but your
                    application still isn't running at the speed of light. What's going on?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making an application scale is generally seen as something that only the most magical of
                    developers can do, but it's easy once you have the correct tools. Fortunately for us, these
                    tools are freely available online!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this talk, we'll take a look at a few options that we have available to work out what our
                    application is actually doing, help identify bottlenecks and fix them so that we can move on to
                    the more important part of the project: delivering features. "

                    A Functional Guide to Cat Herding with PHP Generators
                </h4>

                    <a href="/speakers/mark-baker/">Mark Baker</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    When working with arrays in PHP, three of the most useful functions available to us are
                    arraymap(), arrayfilter() and array_reduce(), which allow us to walk an array and manipulate the
                    value of array elements, select a subset of values from an array, or reduce an array to a single
                    value; all using a callback function to determine exactly what logic should be applied. The use
                    of the callback makes them extremely flexible, and these functions can be particularly powerful,
                    especially when combined (or chained) together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these functions only work with standard PHP arrays; so if we are using Generators as a
                    data source instead of an array, then we can't take advantage of the functionality that they
                    provide. Fortunately, it's very easy to emulate that functionality and apply it to Generators
                    (and also to other Traversable objects like SPL Iterators), giving us access to all of the
                    flexibility and power that mapping, filtering and reducing can offer, and with all the benefits
                    that Generators can offer our code.
                </p>
                <p>So how do we go about implementing filter(), map() and reduce() functions for our Generators? How
                    do we use those functions in our applications? I'll be answering those two questions, and
                    explaining how I keep track of my cats armed only with a GPS Tracker and, PHP Generators, and
                    filter/map/reduce.

                    Fast, discrete APIs are a key part of many web applications and Slim 3 is a fantastic
                    platform
                    for building them. With a focus on PSR-7, the new standard for HTTP messaging in PHP, Slim's
                    middleware focus and ability to get out of the way ensure thats you can buld APIs that are a
                    joy
                    to work with. We'll cover content-type handling, accept header awareness, error handling and
                    all
                    the other things required to ensure that your APIs are easy to integrate with. By the end of
                    this session you will be well placed to write your own APIs with Slim 3.

                    So, you do code reviews, and that's great. But there's always more that you can check during
                    the
                    review. More places you can check for any potential bugs or problems before deployment,
                    before
                    you find yourself with technical debt. Or worse: unforeseen downtime.

                    messages, and common code problems, with examples and tips along the way.
